**(CC2P)** is a Rust-based project that converts CSV files in a selected folder into parquet format. This tool provides a simple and efficient way of handling and converting your CSV data files.


## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.78

### Building

Provide instructions on how to build the project, for example, installing the Rust compiler and necessary crates.

Here is how to install the `cc2p` directly from the Git repository:

```shell
cargo install cc2p
```

### Running

Provide Instructions on how to run the scripts. For example, how to specify the input CSV file and the output Parquet file.

```shell
cc2p [OPTIONS] /path/to/csv/file.csv
```

Options:

- **delimiter** : delimiter char used in CSV files (default: `,`)
- **no-header** : whether to include the header in the CSV search column (default: `false`)
- **worker**: Number of worker threads to use for performing the task (default: `4`)
- **sampling**: Number of rows to sample for inferring the schema (default: `100`)

```shell
> cc2p --help

### MacOS Users

**NOTE for macOS Users:** Our Apple signing/notarization is not entirely done yet,
thus you have to run the following command once to run the application. [Download the app](https://github.com/rayyildiz/cc2p/releases) and run this command:

```shell
xattr -c cc2p
```

## Features

- Fast and reliable CSV to Parquet conversion.
- Multithreaded processing with the help of the [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) crate.
- Progress indication during conversion with the help of the [indicatif](https://docs.rs/indicatif) crate.
